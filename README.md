## Introduction

- [x] Initial commit
This is a basic database scheme with users, user emails, and user roles. This Java Spring REST API application will provide endpoints for clients to perform the various CRUD operations on data sets contained in the application's data.

### Database layout

The table layout is as follows

- User is the driving table.
- Useremails have a Many-To-One relationship with User. Each User has many user email combinations. Each user email combination has only one User.
- Roles have a Many-To-Many relationship with Users.

Two different applications exist

- usermodel - the finished version with all the security features in place.
